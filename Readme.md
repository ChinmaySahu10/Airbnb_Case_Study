### Results and Conclusions

- Bronx & Staten Island has costal region which could be leveraged for more traction of customers
- To generate more revenue Entire Home/apt type should be focused as it has more traction as well good pricing. More offers & services would attract customers.
- Brooklyn has an median price of $90.  As there are already many listings available in Manhattan, Brooklyn can be considered for expansion.
- Average availability of listings in Manhattan Brooklyn is comparatively less than other groups with higher pricing. These areas could be targeted to acquire more properties.
- Shared rooms are frequently available with having less price for accommodation. Listing of shared room to be decreased as the revenue generated would be less
- Also upon values missing in last_review and reviews_per_month carrying NaN values on purpose, meaning they are not missing at random as these hosted sites/places have not received any reviews from the customers. Hence, these places would be least preferred by the future customers and would also be facing bad business from our side.
- As proportion of shared rooms is substantially low these could be targeted with discounts to increase bookings or can be looked into to be converted to other types.
- Weekly or bi-weekly rentals can also be acquired, as these can be used customers stranded in NYC for quarantine purposes.
- More number of hosts & listings with monthly rental duration (30-60-90) can be acquired. We see a good potential in the 30-day rental window. Manhattan & Brooklyn have higher number of 30-day bookings compared to the others; these areas can be further targeted.
- New acquisitions and expansion can be done in the price range of $50 -$200 as it satisfies both parameters of volume of customer traffic and customer satisfaction.
- New acquisitions can be explored to acquire ‘private rooms’ in Manhattan and Brooklyn and ‘entire homes’ in Bronx and Queens.
- Increasing acquisitions and new properties in coastal regions can increase customer bookings.
